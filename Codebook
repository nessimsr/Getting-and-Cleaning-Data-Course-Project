# Summary

The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project’s definition.

## Download the dataset
Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

## Assign each data to variables
features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)
subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features test data
y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
contains test data of activities’code labels
subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features train data
y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
contains train data of activities’code labels

## Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set using rbind and cbind

X <- rbind(x_train, x_test) - created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
Y <- rbind(y_train, y_test) - created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
Subject <- rbind(subject_train, subject_test) - created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
Merged_Data <- cbind(Subject, Y, X) -created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function

## Finding the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
TidyData <- Merged_Data %>% select(subject, code, contains("mean"), contains("std"))

## Labeling the data set with descriptive variable names
- code column in TidyData renamed into activities
- All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
- All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
- All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
- All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
- All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
- All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

# Finilized Data
-Finilized thee clean data with averages of each variable for each activity and each subject and saved it as Final data to a txt file
